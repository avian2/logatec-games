Power allocation game implementation for LOG-a-TEC testbed.

Game type:
1 - game step for experiment 3
2 -
3 - multiple run experiments, measure sum(h_ji*p_j)+n_0 individually
4 - multiple run experiments, measure sum(h_ji*p_j)+n_0 when all opponents transmit
5 - dynamic game, i.e. players come and go
