"""
Demo for the Dynamic (cost adaptive) power allocation game.

A dynamic power allocation game is played between 4 players. Mapping between players and JSI VESNA nodes:
- player 1: transmitter node - JSI Vesna node 51, receiver node  - JSI Vesna node 52
- player 2: tx - node 56, rx - node 59
- player 3: tx - node 54, rx - node 58
- player 4: tx - node 57, rx - node 53
